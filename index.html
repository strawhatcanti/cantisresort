                Not sure what to put here so I'm gonna fill up the space with superfluous text fun fact this website's design
                is based on a domain which was used to (to my knowledge) hold some downloads and patch updates for Hellsinker
                (my favorite game ever) the music you may or may not be hearing right now comes from an earlier project
                of the developer which is called "DOGMA," a doujin 2d fighting game based on the visual novel "KANON"
                I'm pretty fucking beast at the game but it isnt even finished and this is like one of 3 tracks in the files of
                the game oh yeah I read visual novels sometimes too here's my <a href="https://vndb.org/u275360/ulist?vnlist=1">vndb</a>
                list I think I did a pretty good job recreating the site for someone who's just alright at HTML and CSS there's a tiny bit
                of JS used to auto adjust the song's audio levels alright goodbye
